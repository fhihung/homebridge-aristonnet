# Homebridge AristonNet

**Homebridge Plugin for Ariston Aqua Water Heaters**

---

## Description

This Homebridge plugin allows you to seamlessly control your Ariston Aqua Water Heater devices, such as the **Andris** and **Slim** models, through the **AristonNet platform**. It provides functionalities to **get the current temperature**, **set a target temperature**, and **turn the heater on/off** directly from the Homebridge interface.

### Key Features:
- **Temperature Control**: Get real-time temperature data and set a new target temperature for your water heater.
- **Power Control**: Turn the heater on or off as needed.
- **Device Compatibility**: Works with Ariston devices that are connected via the AristonNet platform.

### Requirements:
- **AristonNet Account**: You need an account on the AristonNet platform ([ariston-net.remotethermo.com](https://www.ariston-net.remotethermo.com/)), which is the same as the Ariston mobile app.
- **PlantID**: Locate the PlantID for your device in the URL when logged into the AristonNet platform.

### Setup Instructions:
1. **Log in to AristonNet**: Go to the AristonNet website and log in with your credentials.
2. **Find your PlantID**: In the URL of your device page, find your PlantID to configure the plugin.
3. **Configure the Plugin**: Input your AristonNet account credentials and PlantID into the Homebridge configuration file (`config.json`).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and configure the plugin:

1. **Install Homebridge**:

   ```
3. **Configure the Plugin**: Add the necessary details (email, password, PlantID) to your Homebridge configuration file.

### Alternative Installation (Manual):
If you prefer manual installation (e.g., from a fork):
- Clone the Git repository to a local directory (e.g., `/usr/local/homebridge/plugins/homebridge-aristonnet`).
- Set the plugin directory in the Homebridge options: `-P /usr/local/homebridge/plugins` (typically via `HOMEBRIDGE_OPTS` in `/etc/default/homebridge`).

## Configuration

Here is an example configuration for adding the Ariston Water Heater to Homebridge (`config.json`):

```json
"accessories": [
  {
    "accessory": "AristonWaterHeater",
    "name": "My Heater",             // Customizable device name
    "username": "email@gmail.com",   // Your AristonNet email
    "password": "your_password",     // Your AristonNet password
    "plantId": "your_plant_id",      // Device-specific PlantID
    "model": "VELIS Tech Dry",       // Customizable model name
    "serial_number": "123456789",    // Optional serial number
    "minTemperature": 40,            // Min Temperature
    "maxTemperature": 80             // Max Temperature
  }
]
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials and device information.
